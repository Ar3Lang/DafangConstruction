  "dafang.tooltip.granite_galaxygray": "  Galaxy Gray is a type of dark granite; a marble shares the same name.\\n  Galaxy Gray has a relatively smooth texture and is commonly used for polished slab surfaces in public buildings.",
  "dafang.tooltip.granite_gray": "  'Gray Granite' is a fictional term. In this texture, the gray granite is relatively flat and appears light gray overall.\\n  It mimics real-life 'Sesame White' type granite. The flamed variant has a rougher texture and can be used in modern architecture.",
  "dafang.tooltip.granite_red": "  'Red-Speckled Granite' is a fictional term. In this texture, the red-speckled granite features slight red spots, has a relatively rough texture, and appears mostly gray.\\n  The red spots in granite are typically formed due to the presence of iron-bearing minerals (such as hematite, limonite) or the oxidation of potassium feldspar.",
  "dafang.tooltip.granite_yellowrust": " Yellow Rust Granite is a common bright yellow granite used in construction materials, known for its distinctive yellow veining and rust spots.\n In China, southern regions primarily feature Fujian Rust Stone, while northern regions are known for Wenshang Rust Stone in Shandong.\n It can be processed into polished slabs, flamed slabs, thin slabs, countertops, landscape stones, paving stones, curb stones, small cubes, wall stones, stone furniture, stone carvings, etc.",
